Imperial Lates celebrate the latest in science and engineering at Imperial College London – bringing the public together with resesearchers who not only love what they do, but also love sharing their work with new audiences. Set within the South Kensington Campus, the event welcomes adults of all ages and backgrounds to get hands on with our research, brought to life through live demonstrations, creative workshops, interactive experiments and inspiring talks.

The theme of this Lated edition was _Science Witout Borders_. My exhibition stand was inspired by the question I often got from friends and family when I told them I was off on another field trip: "what exactly _do_ you do on these trips?". And thus was born _The modern geologist's field bag_, a showcase of the different locations me and my research group members had travelled to for fieldwork, as well as a showcase of the tools and equipment we took with us. Everything from the usual hardhats and high-vis jackets, to waterproof notebooks and rock amples, to drones and Schmidt hammers.
