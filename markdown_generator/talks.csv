"Evolution of the North American Landscape: New Insights from Biostratigraphy, Geomorphology and Thermochronology",Poster,AGU-namerica,American Geophysical Union,2018-12-13,"Washington, DC, USA",https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10500772.1,"Reconstructing patterns of topographic evolution is key to our understanding of the various processes responsible for landscape development. Suites of existing geodynamic models suggest the North American landscape has been influenced by a history of evolving dynamic support. This study investigates the extent to which this process has played a role in generating the elevation and long-wavelength topographic relief observed. Review of studies investigating distribution of magmatism, marine sedimentary rocks, sediment flux, thermochronology models, paleoaltimetry and geomorphic analyses all point towards a staged uplift history of North America since the Late Cretaceous. Another way to investigate regional uplift is to use deposits of known age, containing paleo-water depth indicators, as a datum against which post-depositional uplift can be measured. Compilations of paleobathymetry from interpreted biostratigraphic and stratigraphic markers, compared to their present-day elevations, are therefore exploited to give detailed geologic constraints on surface uplift. Our results indicate > 2 km of long-wavelength differential uplift has developed in the continental interior during the Cenozoic. In conjunction with these datasets, the uplift history of North America can be calculated by considering the geomorphic evolution of continental drainage. Results of a calibrated inverse stream-power model are presented, where > 4000 river longitudinal profiles are used to calculate best-fitting smooth spatio-temporal histories of uplift rate. The resulting model also points towards a staged uplift history in most regions of high elevation. Evaluation of results using the biostratigraphic and stratigraphic databases shows the model is broadly consistent with the geological record. As a further validation of the inversion we present a continental landscape evolution model, fed with the uplift history and erosional parameters from the inversion. This outputs elevation, discharge, denudation and sedimentary flux histories that are consistent with our inverse modeling schemes and compiled datasets of sediment flux and low temperature thermochronology. Data and modeling results are in agreement with geodynamic models predicting > 1 km dynamic support of the North American continent."
Global Patterns of Continental Uplift: Insights Inferred from Paleobiological Data,Poster,AGU-pbdb,American Geophysical Union,2019-12-11,"San Francisco, USA",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10501585.1,"Vertical motions of Earth’s surface are used to inform almost all branches of the Earth Sciences, and central role in understanding geological, biological and climatic processes. An important challenge is generating enough information to reliably constrain histories of vertical motion. Significant effort has been expended in generating information about denudation (e.g. from thermochronometry), uplift (e.g. from stable isotopes or drainage analyses) and subsidence patterns. However, a canonical inventory of measurements that determine continental uplift on timescales pertinent to growth and decay of continental topography does not exist. We address this issue using the distribution of unequivocally marine rock recorded in new, detailed, paleobiological inventories. We show that these new compilations of paleobiological and paleoenvironmental data, that were generated to address paleobiological problems, also provide an unprecedented number of self-consistent, high-resolution measurements of continental and ocean island uplift. We focus on the Cretaceous to Recent history, which captures the large-scale marine incursions of the continents. Our results highlight that significant improvements can be made in understanding the histories of the continents in using these measurements of uplift. We present examples from North and South America, southern Africa and Australia to show how this new database can be explored to better understand the processes that generate high topography. They emphasize the importance of large inventories of paleobiological data for understanding long-wavelength uplift and the role tectonic and mantle convective processes play in generating continental topography."
"Invited Talk – A Multi-Proxy Approach to Understanding Continental-scale Landscape Evolution: A North
American Example",Talk,AGU-multi-proxy,American Geophysical Union,2019-12-9,"San Francisco, USA",https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/493066,"The generation and evolution of continental topography are fundamental geologic and geomorphic concerns. In particular, the history of landscape development might contain useful information about the spatio-temporal evolution of deep Earth processes, such as mantle convection. A significant challenge is to generate observations and theoretical predictions of sufficient fidelity that would enable landscape evolution to be constrained at scales of interest. Here, we present a multi-proxy approach to determine how the North American landscape evolved. First, stratigraphic markers are used to estimate post-depositional regional uplift. Present-day elevations of these deposits demonstrate that > 2 km of long wavelength uplift centered on the Colorado-Rocky-Mountain plateaux occurred in Cenozoic times. Secondly, to bridge the gaps between measurements, an inverse modeling scheme is used to calculate the smoothest spatio-temporal pattern of uplift rate that yields the smallest misfit between 4161 observed and calculated longitudinal river profiles. Our results suggest that Cenozoic regional uplift occurred in a series of stages, in agreement with independent stratigraphic observations. Finally, a landscape evolution model driven by this calculated uplift history is used to determine drainage patterns, denudation and sedimentary flux from Late Cretaceous times until the present day. These patterns are broadly consistent with stratigraphic and thermochronologic observations. We conclude that a calibrated inverse modeling strategy can be used to extract the temporal and spatial evolution of the North American landscape at geodynamically useful scales, where Cenozoic sub-plate support has played a defining role in generating topography, especially at wavelengths greater than a few tens of kilometers."

"Quantifying landscape response times to active faulting and bedrock erodibility: Field insights from Calabria, Italy",Poster,AGU-calabria,American Geophysical Union,2019-12-11,"San Francisco, USA",https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/492863,"River topography can provide useful insights into landscape response times in active tectonic regions. Lithology and uplift rate are the two factors widely assumed to control the speed of knickpoint incision, however field constraints quantifying these controls remain sparse. Calabria’s rapidly uplifting landscape since the Late Pleistocene provides an excellent opportunity to explore the influence of lithology and uplift rates in driving knickpoint retreat in rivers crossing active normal faults. First, we use numerical models to estimate knickpoint propagation rates and bedrock erodibility. Then, we use detailed field and structural measurements of in-situ rock strength (Schmidt hammer), fracture density and orientation to quantify rock strength along three rivers with contrasting lithologies crossing the Cittanova, Armo and Santa Eufemia normal faults. Finally, we compare bedrock erodibility estimates with our field measurements of rock strength and published fault slip histories to quantify controls on knickpoint velocities. Modelled bedrock erodibility values in Calabria of ~1.25 x10-5 yr-1 are generally fast when compared with published data for rivers crossing active normal faults. Steepened reaches of the river channels do not spatially correlate with higher compressive rock strength measurements. Instead, we observe that significant scatter in field measurements reflects variable weathering states of the rocks rather than intrinsic compressive bedrock strength. We argue that lithology does not appear to play a significant role in governing the shape or channel narrowing of the river long profiles in Calabria. Instead, our results show that knickzone retreat velocities (5--15 mm yr-1) reflect temporal and spatial patterns of tectonic uplift along mapped active normal faults in the region. These findings suggest uplift rates rather than lithology control landscape response times over timescales of > 105 years in regions of active faulting."
Patterns of Cenozoic Dynamic Topography: An Example from the North American Middle Atlantic Margin,Talk,AGU-patterns,American Geophysical Union,2019-12-12,"San Francisco, USA",https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/493145,"Global eustatic sea-level histories generated by backstripping stratigraphy are predicated upon the lithosphere having a well understood tectonic history. However, sub-plate processes exert important control on lithospheric vertical motions with timescales and amplitudes akin to eustasy, which are difficult to isolate in the geologic record. We integrate stratigraphic and geophysical observations with simple isostatic models to disentangle histories of sub-plate support and eustasy. We focus on the passive margin of Eastern North America. Negative long wavelength free-air gravity anomalies, residual ocean-age depth estimates, fast upper mantle shear wave velocities, and geodynamic models suggest that Cenozoic evolution of this passive margin has been influenced by upper mantle drawdown. We build on existing analyses to backstrip sixteen wells, which, combined with seismic data, constrain timing and extent of Cenozoic post-rift subsidence. Results indicate up to ~600 m of water-loaded subsidence between ~20–0 Ma centered on the Baltimore Canyon Trough. Seismic data from the trough shows Neogene prograding and aggrading clinoforms, with little evidence for faulting or growth strata, indicating that Neogene lithospheric strain rates were low. Amplitude and spatial extent of Neogene subsidence are difficult to explain by glacio-eustasy or glacio-isostatic adjustment. Instead, we suggest that upper mantle drawdown was responsible for the subsidence of the margin. Sub-plate support calculated from conversion of shear wave velocities to temperature and isostatic calculations corroborate this conclusion. Our results highlight how multiple datasets can be combined to resolve climatic and tectonic controls of passive margins, and evaluating mantle and surface process interactions in deep time."
The modern Icelandic landscape: A record of regional uplift from progressive fluvial erosion histories,Poster,AGU-iceland,American Geophysical Union,2018-12-14,"Washington, DC, USA",https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/346412,"Iceland’s dramatic landscapes provide an opportunity to disentangle histories of uplift generated by plate spreading, volcanism, dynamic support, and postglacial rebound. In these actively deforming regions fluvial systems are strongly regulated by uplift, and rapidly evolving river geometries record histories of vertical motions that can be used to examine the driving forces generating topographic relief. Broad knickzones observed along Iceland’s large rivers, and its powerful waterfalls and deep canyons, hint that regional processes have generated significant relief. We constrain how Dettifoss, Europe’s most powerful waterfall, evolved during the Holocene. Using drone photogrammetry, we map the 5 km long Jökulsárgljúfur waterfall system in Iceland and its enclosing canyon at cm-scale accuracy. We combine the resultant digital elevation model with cosmogenic 3He dating of fluvial terraces. Progressive younging of terraces indicates knickzone propagation rates up to ∼70 cm yr-1 during the last 8 ka, which precludes megaflooding as the main erosional mechanism. A calibrated inversion of Iceland’s drainage networks and isostatic calculations indicate that rifting, sub-plate support, and isostatic adjustment resulted in tens to hundreds of meters of regional Holocene uplift. Our results suggest that fluvial processes and knickzone migration set the pace of erosion in postglacial landscapes and that fluvial erosion can rapidly generate hundreds of meters of relief in post-glacial landscapes."
